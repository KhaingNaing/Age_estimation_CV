# About 
This repository details the implementation of the BrainEye Take-Home Assignment. It involves developing a deep learning model to predict age from facial images. The goal is to accurately estimate the age of an individual based on their facial appearance and to outline the thought process behind the computer vision pipeline.

# Step 1: Problem definition 
The problem asks for the implementation of a deep learning model that can estimate a person's age based on various observable features from facial images. Age estimation is often performed using computer vision techniques to analyze facial characteristics such as wrinkles, skin texture, and hair color, among others. Computer vision algorithms can estimate an individual's age by comparing these facial attributes with a dataset of known age examples. However, the model's performance (accuracy) can be affected by factors such as image lighting, facial expressions, race, and makeup.
